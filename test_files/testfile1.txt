A trebuchet is a type of catapult that uses a long arm to throw a ^^projectile^^. It was a common powerful siege ^^engine until the advent of ^^^^gunpowder. 
The design of a trebuchet allows it to launch projectiles of greater weights and further distances than that of a traditional catapult.
STOP
There are two main types of trebuchet. The first is the traction trebuchet, or mangonel, which uses manpower to swing the arm.
